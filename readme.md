# kendo-react-dashboard
This is a Dashboad created using KendoReact components, the basic idea to build this tutorial came from a demo our engineering team built here:
[github/telerik: kendo-react-sales-dashboard](https://github.com/telerik/kendo-react-sales-dashboard)

This repo is the source code for a blog tutorial that steps you through creating a similar React dashboard from scratch using Create React App and KendoReact. That tutorial can be found here:
[telerik blog: Let's Build a Sales Dashboard with React](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/lets-build-a-sales-dashboard-with-react)

If you happen to come across this code in thu future, if the internet is still a thing you can find this repo here:
